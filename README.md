Design and modeling of a double branchline coupler in HFSS

Core operating frequency: 10.0 GHz

Band: 20% (9.0 GHz – 11.0 GHz)

Requirements (on all bands):
- Insertion loss below 3.8 dB = L =-20log(S21) - S12 graph
- Down coupling of 3.8 dB = C = -20log(1-S21^2) - S13 graph
- Insulation above 20 dB = I = -20log(S41) - S14 chart
- Reflection below -20 dB on all ports (50Ω) - S11 graph

D=I-C Directivity

The design should be done seeking to minimize the final size of the device.
